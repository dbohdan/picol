The regexp.h/regexp.c library is by Tor Andersson
(https://github.com/ccxvii/minilibs).

The library collection it is from carries the following note: "These libraries
are in the public domain (or the equivalent where that is not possible). You
can do anything you want with them. You have no legal obligation to do
anything else, although I appreciate attribution."
