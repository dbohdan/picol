Update 2007-05-01: 0.1.22: 1700 loc in picol.c, 126 in picol.h
New: emulated the auto_load mechanism: picol.c calls unknown if available; init,pcl
implements it by sourcing tclIndex files as on auto_path; there's one tclIndex that
prepares auto_index(parray) to source parray.tcl.
Long and complicated way, but similar to how Tcl does it :)
Also new: uplevel #0

Update 2007-04-22, 0.1.20: 1719 loc, 88 commands, 277 tests (in test.pcl)
Added some 8.5 features: {*} (only for $var or [cmd], not for {const..} or "const"), 
in/ni operators. Also, at startup ./init.pcl is sourced if present (it currently 
contains workarounds for [glob] and [pwd], which might only work under Cygwin or *n*x).

Update 2007-04-15, 0.1.19:
Several minor fixes. Most important, added ARITY2 macro to display a "wrong # args" 
message, but also to be extracted for a little auto-documentation, as I was getting 
tired of tracking what I've done.
The attached script help.pcl extracts the usage messages from ./picol.c (or the file 
specified on command line) to stdout. See help.txt for a snapshot of it.
Also included is wc-l.pcl as finger exercise  - works mostly like Cygwin's wc -l, 
just slower :)

Update 2007-04-12 0.1.18:
lsort empty list crash fixed
math operators in many cases variadic (FOLD: +, *, -, && new || new), unary minus
simple ternary [expr] introduced
